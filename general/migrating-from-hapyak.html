    <p>This topic provides an overview on how to migrate from using HapYak to using Brightcove Interactivity.  If you are just getting started with Brightcove Interactivity, check out <a href="/interactivity/getting-started/getting-started-interactivity-module.html">Getting Started with the Interactivity Module</a>. </p>

    <h2 id="bc-publish">Content published through the Brightcove/HapYak plugin</h2>
    <p>If your HapYak projects were generated using the HapYak/Brightcove plugin and your content is currently deployed as  Brightcove embed code/URL, the process to transition  customer-facing interactive elements from the HapYak instance to the Brightcove Interactivity version is simple. Once the HapYak content migration occurs, follow these steps to update your customer-facing content to the new Brightcove versions.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Enable Brightcove Interactivity on any players you are currently using to serve HapYak-enabled interactivity.
        <ul>
          <li> Open the <strong>Players</strong> module</li>
          <li>Click on a <strong>Name</strong></li>
          <li>In <strong>Additional Features</strong> &gt; <strong>Interactivity</strong>, check the <strong>Enable Interactivity</strong> option

        <p>The checkbox to <strong>Enable Interactivity</strong> will replace the need for entering any API key data.</p>
      </li>
      <li>If any custom tracking scripts were being used, enable the <strong>Options (JSON)</strong> checkbox and enter the script.</li>
      <li><strong>(Optional)</strong> If you would like to have projects auto-created when they are played with an Interactivity-enabled Brightcove Player (similar to functionality from the HapYak/Brightcove plugin), you will need to enable project auto-creation on your player. To do this, add the following to the <strong>Options(JSON)</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img alt="" src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/general/migrate/auto-create.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Delete the existing <strong>hapyak</strong> plugin on the player (click <strong>Plugins</strong> in the navigation).
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img alt="" src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/general/migrate/delete-plugin.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Save the changes and publish  the player.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>After caching clears, the Brightcove Interactivity versions of the interactive content should automatically replace the HapYak versions. Customer-facing experiences should continue functioning seamlessly on the new platform.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: To facilitate a smooth update process, we recommend that you upload versions of any non-Brightcove videos used as source files for HapYak content into Video Cloud before starting this process.</aside>
    <p>If your interactive content was not published using a Brightcove embed code via the HapYak plugin (typical examples include direct publishing from HapYak embed code and non-Brightcove based projects) you will still have a path to easily update your content. During the HapYak content migration, Brightcove Interactivity versions of all your interactive content will be generated. In cases where a non-Brightcove video was used as the video source file, the migration will create a &quot;headless&quot; project retaining all of your interactive content. You will be required you to update the project settings and select a valid Brightcove video source file (that exists in the Media module).</p>
