    <h2 id="configure-player">Before you get started</h2>
    <p>Before you can add  interactivity to a player, you need a HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player and you need to make sure a Brightcove Interactivity project has been created. For information on how to do this, see <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}platform/getting-started/getting-started-interactivity.html">Getting Started with Interactivity</a>.</p>

    <p>To access the quiz options, click <strong>Options</strong> on the quiz dialog.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/platform/annotations/quiz/quiz-options.png"></figure>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show cancel button</strong> - Adds a <strong>cancel</strong> button to the quiz allowing the viewer to skip and not answer the quiz. Uncheck if you want to ensure a submission. </li>
      <li><strong>Randomize choices</strong> - Randomly orders the choices for the viewer.<i></i></li>
      <li><strong>Review screen</strong> - What the viewer sees after they submit. Details <a href="#review-screen">below</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Pass/Fail actions</strong> - You can change what the viewer sees next based on correct or incorrect answers to the quiz. This is known as "adaptive quizzing". Details <a href="#passfail-actions">below</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Answer types</strong> - By default there is only one correct choice per question. Here you can opt to allow <i>multiple correct choices, </i>and if desired, require all correct choices to be selected for the question to be answered correctly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="review-screen">Review Screen</h3>
    <p>To access the review screen options, click <strong>Review screen</strong> on the quiz options menu.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/platform/annotations/quiz/review-screen.png"></figure>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Show review screen</strong> - Uncheck if you would like the video to simply play after a submit.</li>
      <li><strong>Allow retry</strong><b> - </b>Allows  the viewer to resubmit their answer if they answered incorrectly.</li>
      <li><strong>Allow viewer to see correct answer(s)</strong> - Allows the viewer to see which answer(s) were correct if they answered incorrectly.</li>
      <li><strong>Review screen message</strong> - Set a text message that the viewer sees after they submit. Default is "Review your answers." </li>

    <h3 id="passfail-actions">Pass/Fail actions</h3>
    <p>To access the Pass/Fail actions options, click <strong>Pass/Fail actions</strong> on the quiz options menu.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/platform/annotations/quiz/pass-fail.png"></figure>
    <p>There are <strong>On Pass</strong> and <strong>On Fail</strong> tabs that can be configured based on whether the viewer passes or fails the  quiz. By default, to "pass" the quiz, the viewer must answer at least 51% of the questions correctly. This can be adjusted by clicking <strong>Set custom pass/fail threshold</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Load URL </strong> - Automatically load any URL (to a web page, another interactive video, another lesson, a PDF, a supplemental learning resource, a landing page, etc.).</li>
      <li><strong>Jump to video time</strong> - Go to any annotation in the video or to a specific custom time.</li>
      <li><strong>Jump to video</strong> (Available for <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}platform/experiences/experiences-overview.html">experiences</a> only) - Go to any video in an experience. If you have a video and a video time selected it will jump to that time in the new video.</li>
      <li><strong>Load track ID# </strong><i></i>- (Advanced) Load an entire new track of annotations. This is a rarely used feature.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> <i>- </i> Set a JavaScript variable. Typically used to update a score in a separate annotation or a separate system like an LMS.</li>
      <li><strong>Alternate message on pass / fail</strong> - Show a different message depending on how the viewer did on the quiz (for example, "That's not quite right, let's try again...").</li>
      <li><strong>Reset questions</strong> (On Fail tab only) - You can choose whether or not to show the quiz to the viewer again if they reach that point in the video again (for example, if they were branched back to an earlier part of the video to review a specific section and then you wanted them to answer the quiz again).</li>
      <li><strong>Set custom pass/fail threshold</strong> - Check to enter a custom passing score</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Notes on setting a custom
      pass/fail threshold</h4>
    <p>When quizzes are used for assessment, Brightcove Interactivity records a pass / fail determination for each quiz. Since the quiz annotation supports more than one question, the pass/fail threshold lets you define what percentage of those questions must be answered correctly for the user to "pass."</p>
    <p>By default, the threshold to pass any quiz is 51%. You can override this percentage to apply your own standards. This is a tricky feature though, here's why. Brightcove Interactivity reports do not currently show "pass/fail" determinations, they only show correct/incorrect at the individual question level. The reason this feature exists is to properly mark the data for customers with a Learning Management System (LMS) integration or who use our APIs directly to access the data.</p>

    <h2 id="quiz-gating">Requiring a user pass a quiz before advancing in a video</h2>
    <p>A common use case is to require that a viewer &quot;pass&quot; a quiz before they can advance forward in the video. This is referred to as &quot;conditional gating&quot; and this is supported by Brightcove Interactivity.</p>
    <p>Follow these steps when configuring the quiz:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Click <strong>Edit</strong> on the annotation.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>Gate</strong> menu to set <strong>Gate:Y</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Review screen</strong>.</li>
      <li>Uncheck<strong> Allow viewer to see correct answer(s)</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">SUBMIT</span>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Options</strong> &gt; <strong>Pass/Fail actions</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>On Fail</strong> tab.</li>
      <li>Set <strong>Jump to video time</strong> to a <strong>Custom time</strong> of <strong>00:00.000 seconds</strong>.</li>
      <li>Check <strong>Reset questions</strong>.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">SUBMIT</span>.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Done</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A viewer will not be able to proceed in the video until they have correctly answered the question.&nbsp;View an example <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}platform/demos/gated-quiz-demo.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
