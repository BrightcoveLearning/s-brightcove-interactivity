    <p>Automatically loading a URL without a user-initiated action is generally a discouraged UX practice. In many cases, browsers will  prohibit this.</p>
    <p>Annotations don't have the capability to load a URL without a user action. However, if you're technically inclined, this can be done using  our <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}platform/references/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">APIs</a>. You would create a JavaScript listener for the video-complete event, then perform the desired action. If you decide to take that approach, Brightcove can provide some code examples to help.</p>
    <p>Here's a working example:</p>
    <a href="http://jsbin.com/wilaq/1/edit" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://jsbin.com/wilaq/1/edit</a>
    <p>At the end of the video, it auto navigates to hapyak.com.  Here are the important lines of code:</p>
    <br>
    <pre><code>onTrackingEvent: function(data) { 
    &nbsp; &nbsp;if (data.event==="Player Action" &amp;&amp;<br> data.properties.Action.indexOf("End")===0) { 
    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; window.location.href = "http://corp.hapyak.com"}} &nbsp;</code></pre>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: This will work on an iPhone (even when the video is playing in the native QuickTime app).</aside>
