    <h2 id="what-is-interactive-video">What is interactive video?</h2>
    <p>Interactive video is video that works like the web. You can click it, you can jump to what you want, and it reacts to your actions, making it more engaging. One of the things that businesses like most about interactive video is that it can be measured, so they have concrete evidence about what's effective and can make informed decisions to make it even better.</p>

    <h2 id="what-are-annotations">What are annotations?</h2>
    <p>Anything you add to a video using the Interactivity module. An annotation can be  a text overlay, a link, a chapter menu or a quiz for example. An annotation enhances the video and is synchronized to it, so it looks like part of the video and shows up while the video is playing.</p>

    <h2 id="what-are-templates">What are templates?</h2>
    <p>A "template" is a re-usable track that contains annotations you want to show up on dozens or hundreds of videos. Typically a template is used for common interactions, like a call-to-action that isn't specific to one video. </p>
