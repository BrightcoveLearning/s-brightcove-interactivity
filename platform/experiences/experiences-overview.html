    <p>A Brightcove Interactivity Experience is a video with other elements (like synced slides or an e-commerce cart) outside the video player that dynamically interact with video player.</p>
    <p>Experiences allow you to dynamically communicate between a video and the web page itself, opening the door to a new generation of lean-forward interactive realities for your viewers.</p>

    <p>A <b>Video Landing Page</b> experience is a great way to create a playlist of videos, set up a dedicated landing page link, and quickly add branding to the header and footers to the landing page.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are two types of <b>Video Landing Pages:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Single Video Landing Page</b> - Hide the other videos from the user's view, forcing the user to navigate only via the branching/CYOA annotations </li>
      <li><b>Playlist Landing Page</b> - Show all videos included in the experience at the bottom of the screen, allowing users to quickly jump from video to video at will</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="slidesync">Slide Sync</h3>
    <p><b>Slide Sync</b> is a powerful interactive video experience allowing users to present related slide decks or presentation imagery while the video plays. For information on creating a Slide Sync Experience, see <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}platform/experiences/creating-slide-sync-experience.html">Creating a Slide Sync Experience</a>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Experiences use a HapYak Player with native controls as the embed type. This is so multi-video experiences have a standard look and feel.</li>
      <li>Viewer interaction on the standard  annotations is included in <a href="http://www.hapyak.com/portal/reports" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"> Reports</a> as normal.</li>
