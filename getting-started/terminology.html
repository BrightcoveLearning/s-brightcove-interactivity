    <h2 id="what-is-interactive-video">What is interactive video?</h2>
    <p>Interactive video is video that works like the web. You can click it, you can jump to what you want, and it reacts to your actions, making it more engaging. One of the things that businesses like most about interactive video is that it can be measured, so they have concrete evidence about what's effective and can make informed decisions to make it even better.</p>

    <h2 id="what-are-annotations">What are annotations?</h2>
    <p>Anything you add to a video using HapYak; an overlay, a link, or a quiz are all annotations. An annotation enhances the video and is synchronized to it, so it looks like part of the video and shows up while you're watching.</p>
