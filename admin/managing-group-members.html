    <p>To add a new group member:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>In the <strong>Invites</strong> section, enter the email address of the user.</li>
      <li>Assign a <strong>Role</strong> to the user:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Admin</b> - Access to all functionality, including configuring styles and add-ons for projects, viewing reports, creating sub-groups, and inviting new users</li>
          <li><b>Editor</b> - Can create, edit, and share projects and can view and download reports; Cannot view or adjust group level settings</li>

      <li>Click <strong>Invite</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The user will receive an email message stating that they have been invited to join the group. The recipient should click on the link and then follow the instructions to complete the process.
