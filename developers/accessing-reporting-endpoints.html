    <p>Brightcove Interactivity provides programmatic access to the reporting data shown in the Studio Reports user interface. This document provides details on how to access the API containing that data from a server-side process like Python or cURL.</p>
  </section>

    <h3>Base URL</h3>
    <p>The base URL for reporting requests:</p>
    <p><code>https://interactivity-reporting.api.brightcove.com/api/reports/v2/</code> </p>
    <h3>Authenticating requests</h3>
    <p>The reporting API uses Brightcove's <a href="/oauth/">OAuth system</a> for authentication, using the client credential flow. This means that you obtain client credentials (a <code translate="No">client_id</code> and <code translate="No">client_secret</code>) and use those to obtain an <strong>access token</strong> which is submitted in the Authorization header like this:</p>
    <pre><code translate="No">Authorization: Bearer <span class="bcls-highlight">access_token_here</span></code></pre>
    <p>To generate the Access Token, see the information on <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/oauth/guides/getting-access-tokens.html">Getting Access Tokens</a>.</p>
    <p>The easiest way to get client credentials is through Studio - see <a href="/general/managing-api-authentication-credentials.html">Managing API Credentials</a>. The permissions you need for Interactivity are:</p>

    </figure>
    <p>You can find your own reporting API key on the integrations tab of the admin section of the Brightcove Interactivity Portal. 
      Treat your reporting API key with the 
      sensitivity of a password as anyone with it can use it to retrieve reporting data from your account.</p>
    <p>Base URL for reporting requests:</p>
    <p><strong>Example URL structure</strong></p>
    <code translate="no">https://[base-url]/[report-name]?send_status=true&[parameters]</code> 
    <p><strong>Example request</strong></p>
    <code translate="No">interactivity-reporting.api.brightcove.com/api/reports/v2/project_engagement_summary_raw?send_status=true&account_id=6415650835001</code>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="api-request">API request construction</h2>
    <p>The API is invoked via GET operation to the Base API URL. The request must contain a valid <code>Authorization</code> header. Specific reports are requested by appending the name of the report and valid parameters to the Base API URL.</p>
    <p><strong>Results are not synchronously returned.</strong> The reporting API operation is asynchronous in that results may not be available when your request returns. In this case your request will be queued and you will need to poll, or try later, for results.</p>
    <p>Requests must always include <code>send_status=true</code> which forces the API to return HTTP 202 status while the reporting request is processing and then HTTP 200 with results when it is complete.</p>
    <p>To determine if you need to &quot;poll&quot; for results, examine the HTTP status code returned by the API. If it is &quot;202 Accepted&quot; your report is still being generated and youâ€™ll need to repeat the request a little bit later to retrieve results. The results are returned with an HTTP 200 status code when they are complete. 
      Once complete, reporting results are cached for one day and are returned immediately with each request.</p>

    <h2 id="report-params">Report parameters</h2>
    <p>All report end_points accept the following parameters:</p>
    <h3>start</h3>
    <p>Start date for report results. Default value is 7 days before &quot;end&quot; date. Format for dates is YYYY-MM-DD. All times are UTC.</p>
    <h3>end</h3>
    <p>End date for report results. Default value is end of current day. For example if today is 2021-09-23, the default end date is 2021-09-23 23:59:59.999.</p>
    <h3>format</h3>
    <p>Output format for report results. Supported values are: csv and json.</p>
    <h3>send_status</h3> 
<p>For easier interaction with the API we suggest that you always include <code>send_status=true</code>. This forces the API to return HTTP 202 status while the reporting request is processing and then HTTP 200 with results when it is complete.</p>
<aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Modifying any of the API parameters will modify the underlying report query and require the report to be re-processed.</aside>

    <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="details">Important details: limits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maximum row count</strong> - The API limits the returned results to 500,000 rows of output. Output beyond this limit is omitted from the results.</li>
      <li><strong>Maximum time range</strong> - The API limits the time range of data retrieved to six months.</li>
      <li><strong>Rate limits</strong> - By default, the reporting API limits you to running 4 reports per minute; 20 per hour; and 100 per day. These limits apply to the number of unique reports you can execute, not the number of times you hit the reporting endpoint to retrieve results or check status on an already queued report.</li>
