    <p>Lesson Experiences allow you to create entire learning experiences through interactive video by setting grading criteria to a video.  Lessons are constructed to allow you to easily pass data to an LMS like Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, and many others through either LTI or SCORM.  Using Lessons can streamline the lesson creation process using SCORM 1.2 or 2004 delivery standards. Available grading criteria include percent watched, threshold, and quiz score.</p>
