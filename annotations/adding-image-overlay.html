    <p>Brightcove Interactivity Studio provides the ability to add different types of interactive overlays to videos. Text and image overlays can be displayed on videos during video playback. For example, overlays can display additional text or a company logo on a video. Overlays can also be clickable and open additional web pages if needed.</p>

    <p>Before you can add  interactivity to a player, you need a HapYak-enabled Brightcove Player and you need to make sure a Brightcove Interactivity project has been created. For information on how to do this, see <a href="/getting-started/getting-started-interactivity.html">Getting Started with Interactivity</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="image-overlay">Adding an image overlay</h2>
    <p>Image overlays are used to display an image on a video during playback. The overlay can also be clickable and open another browser page when clicked. In the following example, the image overlay will appear at the 75% point of the video and display until the end of the video. Clicking the overlay will open a link in a new browser tab and pause the video.</p>
    <div style="position: relative; display: block; max-width: 960px;">
      <div style="padding-top: 56.25%;">

    <h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
    <h3>File size</h3>
    <p>Image annotations are loaded dynamically when the viewer reaches a certain point in the video. So it's a good idea (as with all images on the web) to ensure a good balance between high quality and low file size. A good rule of thumb for image annotations are to keep them <strong>below 200 KB</strong>. Like any web based technology, the more images you load up, the longer it will take to load the page.</p>
    <h3>PNG or JPG?</h3>
    <p>Most image annotations we see are PNGs as those include a transparency layer that ensures the image seamlessly blends with the video. We especially recommend minimizing the size of PNG files with a service like <a href="https://tinypng.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">TinyPNG</a>.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>JPGs work just as well of course. However, they don't have a transparency layer, so take care when using them.</p>
    <h3>Upload File or URL?</h3>
    <p>We recommend following your normal workflow. If you usually upload images for your website or other content to a third-party system like Amazon S3 or Wordpress, continue doing that. If you normally upload directly from your system, then simply use the "Upload File" option.</p>
