    <p>Brightcove Interactivity offers two techniques for creating branching or &quot;choose your own adventure&quot;  content.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-video branching</strong> - This technique uses a single video. The viewer jumps from point to point in the <strong>same video</strong> using annotations.</li>
      <li><strong>Video to video branching</strong> - This technique uses a <a href="/experiences/creating-branching-experience.html">Branching Experience</a> where multiple videos are strung together. The viewer jumps from video to video using annotations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both work equally well, it's a personal preference based on your production process and how your videos are  produced.</p>

    <h2 id="sample">Working sample</h2>
    <p>The following video is an example of in-video branching. The &quot;main menu&quot; part of the video will loop until an image is clicked. Clicking an image will jump to that part of the video. When that part of the video is complete, a time triggered action will send the video back to the &quot;main menu&quot; part of the video. The &quot;Main Menu&quot; text that appears in parts of the video is a transparent overlay that will jump to the main menu part of the video when clicked.</p>

    <h2 id="in-video-branching">Branching within a single project</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to add branching to a project:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>Open the <strong>Interactivity</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Click on a project <strong>Title</strong> to open it.</li>
      <li>Add a chapter marker at each point in the video where a choice begins (the beginning of a branch). The chapter markers will be invisible to viewers.</li>
      <li>For each &quot;choice point&quot;, add a text, image or transparent overlay annotation. This is what the viewer will click on to jump to different parts of the video. Make sure the start time and duration for each of these annotations is identical.</li>
      <li>On each annotation, open the <strong>Link</strong> &gt; <strong>ACTIONS</strong> tab and set the <strong>Jump to video time </strong>and select the correct chapter or enter a custom time. In this example, a transparent overlay is configured to jump to a chapter marker when clicked.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
      <li>On one of the choice annotations, open the <strong>Link</strong> &gt; <strong>BEHAVIOR</strong> tab and set the <strong>Action to take if the viewer doesn't click</strong> to <strong>Loop back</strong>.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> This will cause the video to loop and display the &quot;main menu&quot; part of the video until one of the transparent overlays is clicked.<img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/projects/in-video-branching/loop-back.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
      <li>At the end of each branch, add a time triggered action and set the <strong>Jump to video time</strong> to jump the video back to the &quot;main menu&quot; part of the video so the viewer can make another choice.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/projects/in-video-branching/time-trigger.png"> </figure>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: By design, the time triggered annotation does not perform its intended functionality while in edit mode. This is to avoid disrupting the editing flow. To test, click <span class="button-blue">Embed</span> and then click the <strong>Preview</strong> link to preview the annotation.</aside>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: When using a time triggered action, Brightcove recommends that the Start/End Time is configured to last at least one second. Using a shorter time may cause the browser to not execute the time triggered action.</aside>
