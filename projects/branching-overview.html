    <p>Brightcove Interactivity offers two techniques for creating branching or &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; (CYOA) content.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>In-Video branching</strong> - This technique uses a single video. The viewer jumps from point to point in the <strong>same video</strong> using annotations.  For information on in-video branching, see <a href="/interactivity/projects/in-video-branching.html">Creating an In-Video Branching Project</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Video to video branching</strong> - This technique uses a Branching Experience where multiple videos are strung together. The viewer jumps from video to video using annotations. For information on creating a Branching Experience, see <a href="/interactivity/experiences/creating-branching-experience.html">Creating a Branching Experience</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Both work equally well, it's a personal preference based on your production process and how your videos are  produced.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Focus on just 2 or 3 choices at each choice point. Having fewer choices is much easier for viewers to process and results in higher interaction rates.</li>
      <li>Make sure each choice point lasts for at least 10 seconds.</li>
      <li>Add bumpers (sections of white or black or motion graphics) between the different choice sections to ease the transition. We recommend about 5 seconds.</li>
      <li>Always allow the viewer to return to the choice points. You'll be surprised at how many viewers want to watch a branching video over and over again. To do this, simply add a text or image annotation that links back to the choice point.</li>
      <li>Continue the audio track underneath the choice points and bumpers. This creates a more seamless experience for the viewer.</li>
    </ul>
