    <h2 id="project-creation">Automatically creating a Brightcove Interactivity project</h2>
    <p>Video Cloud videos that are played using an <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}getting-started/configuring-player-plugin.html">interactivity-enabled</a> Brightcove Player will automatically create Brightcove Interactivity projects. This is the preferred method to create a project. </p>
    <p>When a video is played inside of a interactivity-enabled Brightcove Player, the following things happen: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Brightcove video ID, title, tags and custom fields are passed to Brightcove Interactivity</li>
      <li>Brightcove Interactivity attempts to look up the video ID within your group</li>
      <li><strong>If no matching record is found</strong>, then Brightcove Interactivity creates a project with the data that was sent</li>
      <li>Brightcove Interactivity will also set the project properties to indicate that it was "auto created":
        <ul>
          <li> The <code>is_published</code> value will be set to <strong>TRUE</strong></li>
          <li> A tag with the value <code>live</code> will be added</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following steps will automatically create a Brightcove Interactivity project. Make sure you have an <a href="{{ site.interactivity_prefix }}getting-started/configuring-player-plugin.html">interactivity-enabled Brightcove Player</a> before continuing:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Video Cloud Studio.</li>
      <li>Open the <strong>Media</strong> module.</li>
      <li>Select a video to publish by checking the box next to the video thumbnail.</li>
      <li>Click <span class="button-blue">Publish and embed... ˇ</span> &gt; <strong>Publish to web.</strong></li>
      <li>Select an interactivity-enabled Brightcove Player.</li>
      <li>Click the preview link to open a preview in a new browser tab.

      </li>
      <li>Play the preview video (the video only needs to be played for a few seconds). This will auto-create a project in Brightcove Interactivity.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: You must preview the video using the preview link. Previewing the video with the preview player in the Media module <strong>will not</strong> auto-create a project.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation, click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
      <li>A list of projects will appear. Confirm the video you just published appears in the project list.

        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The <strong>Tags</strong> column includes all tags associated with the video. An additional tag of <strong>live</strong> is added to each project automatically created by the plugin.</aside>

    <h2 id="create">Manually creating a new project</h2>
    <p>If needed, you can manually create projects using Brightcove Interactivity Studio. Follow these steps to manually create a project.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Interactivity Studio.</li>
      <li>In the primary navigation, click <strong>Create</strong> and then <span class="button-blue">NEW PROJECT</span> or click <strong>Manage</strong>, click the <strong>Projects</strong> tab and then click <span class="button-blue">New Project</span>. </li>
      <li>There are three ways users can upload video content to a project.
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the <strong>URL or Embed Code</strong>﻿ of your video and paste into Brightcove Interactivity Studio</li>
          <li><strong>Upload</strong> a video file by dragging it from your desktop or browsing your computer </li>
          <li><strong>Browse My Videos</strong> and select previously uploaded video files</li>
        </ul>
        <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/projects/create-projects/choose-video-dialog.png"> </figure>
      </li>
      <li>Select an <strong>Embed type</strong>. This is usually where the video is hosted. &nbsp;If your URL is directly to a video file (ending in ".mp4" for example) select an open source player (like Video.js).</li>
      <li>Enter a title and click <span class="button-blue">Next</span>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should see the project load. If you get an error, click <span class="button-blue">New Project</span> again. Ensure that the URL, embed code, or file type of the video is a supported format. &nbsp;If you continue to have trouble, or if your video player is not listed, send an email to <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Brightcove Support</a> and we'll add it to the list.</p>

    <h2 id="copy">Copying projects</h2>
    <p>On the list of projects, hover over the right side of the project and click the copy icon (<img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/projects/icon-copy.png">). </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"> <img src="/assets/images/s-brightcove-interactivity-img/projects/create-projects/project-list.png"> </figure>
    <p>This will create an exact clone of the project including all annotations, tags, and custom CSS, titled "Copy of {project_name}".</p>
    <p>This is a great way to save time when creating new projects that are similar to ones already created. Simply change the video source of the new cloned project and adjust the annotations as needed.</p>
    <h3 id="copy-different-group">Copying a project into different group</h3>
    <p>Fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdtkSC34ioJyL_mFOEjBvCFcME5gkb7eheAV96rx2IOrMENVQ/viewform" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">this form</a>. Brightcove Support will copy the project in our back end and email you back confirmation when it's complete.</p>
